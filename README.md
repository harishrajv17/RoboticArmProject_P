# Robotic Arm P â€“ Mechatronics Project

This repository documents the design, implementation, and control of **Robot P**, a 2-DoF robotic arm developed for a university mechatronics module. The project integrates **mechanical design**, **kinematic modeling**, and **PID control**, with both simulation (MATLAB/Simulink) and real-time implementation (Arduino Mega).

## Kinematics Summary

**Forward Kinematics**:
\[
x = 0.25\cos(\theta) + h\cos(\gamma) \\
z = 0.25\sin(\theta) + h\sin(\gamma) + \Delta d
\]

**Inverse Kinematics**:
\[
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x - h\cos(\gamma)}{0.25}\right) \\
\Delta d = z - 0.25\sin(\theta) - h\sin(\gamma)
\]
